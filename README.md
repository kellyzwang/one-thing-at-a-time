## Work Plan

### Feature 1: To Do List

### Feature 2: Flowtime Technique
How does it work?

You start by writing down the date, an estimated work time, and *one* task you plan to work on during a focus session. Once you've picked your task, write down the time you start working on it, and then work until you feel like you need a break. You're not working for any specific amount of time, and there's no timer that signals when it's time for a break. The estimated work time you wrote down is just for reference and planning. Instead, you just have to monitor your focus and thoughts. When you start feeling tired or distracted, write down the end time, and take a break. The length of your break is also up to you.

### Feature 3: Analysis
An analysis tab that visualizes your work time interactively.

### Feature 4: Motivation
- `New Quote` button that displays a new motivational quote for productivity.
- `Add New Quote` button that allows user to add quotes.
- `Manage Quotes` button -- display all quotes in the database with remove buttons.
